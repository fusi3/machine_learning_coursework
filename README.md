Logistic Regression and Random Forests were used to classify songs from Spotify as to whether they were popular or not. Originally my own personal library was planned to be used but Spotify's API limitiations were not allowing me to scrape all my data efficiently and so a freely available dataset was used instead. 

ALl results and analysis have also been uploaded. You may not be able to run the notebooks as the data was not uploaded given its size, but the notebooks can results can still be viewed.
